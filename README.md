# Financial Portfolio Analysis

This project analyses the value generation of 5 different assets that were part of a portfolio with different weights over the course of three years - from 2019 until 2021.

How much money has been invested at the beginning into the portfolio is unknown. For this reason, any results here can be adapted for different starting points.

## The data

### The Asset Information

We have two Fixed Income assets, two Equity assets and one Alternative asset.

### The Price of the Assets

We have daily information about the price of the asset. Whenever the value of the price was empty, we assumed no change in price and inserted the price of the previous day

### The Asset Weight

We have daily information about what weight each asset has per day. Together all asset weights per day are 1, which represents 100% of the investment per day. Each weight tells us how much of the toal investment is put into which asset.


# Asset evaluation over Time

All assets grow over time, although all had a dip during covid in spring 2020.
Calculating the return of each asset we checked the percentage growth of the price to the previous day.

# Asset Correlation

All assets are somewhat highly correlated to each other except for asset 1 (although asset 1 is from the same family as asset 2). The returns of asset 2 and 3 are most highly correlated - albeit the correlation being modest and the asset 2 and 3 not being from the same family it is interesting.

# Asset Weights

Asset weights it seems were re-evaluated only once a year and only change in January 2020 and January 2021.

# The cumulative returns

The cumulative returns demonstrate a strong asset growth over time despite the dip during spring 2020. Money earned was re-invested each time.

# Annual metrics

- Annualized Return: 11.07 %
- Annualized Volatility: 8.36 %

# Asset weights grouped by family

Assets weight was more or less equally distributed around the amount of assets per family. Each asset had a weight floating around 20%.
